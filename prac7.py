# PRAC AIM:Lapindrome is defined as a string which when split in the middle, 
# gives two halves having the same characters and same frequency of each character. 
# If there are odd number of characters in the string, we ignore the middle character and check for lapindrome. 
# For example gaga is a lapindrome, since the two halves ga and ga have the same characters with same frequency.
# Also, abccab, rotor and xyzxy are a few examples of lapindromes. Note that abbaab is NOT a lapindrome. 
# The two halves contain the same characters but their frequencies do not match. Your task is simple. 
# Given a string, you need to tell if it is a lapindrome.
